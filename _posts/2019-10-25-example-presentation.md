### ABSTRACT
Many attempts have been made to discuss the properties of approximators zuǒyoù,
shàngxià, and qiánhoù. However, most research particularly focuses on individual
meanings. A more systematic account of the overlapped and non-overlapped usages of
approximators that often confuse non-native speakers seem to be paid less attention to.

This project first reviews the syntactic and semantic properties of the three approximators
in the literature. It then further examines empirical data from Mandarin corpora, such as
Academia Sinica Corpus and The Chinese Web Corpus (zhTenTen) from Sketch Engine.
Consequently, a table illustrating the frequency of collocation based on Chinese users’
conventional usages is formulated.

Adapting the cognitive approaches of Lakoff (1987)
and Tyler and Evans (2003), I construct the proto and extended scenes among these three
approximators. The proposed network figure thus clearly demonstrates the domains that
each approximator modifies. Their overlapped and non-overlapped usages are also
presented in the network figure.

It is hoped that the results of this study will help us further understand the nature and the comparisons among these approximators, and how speakers
conceptualize their meanings and use them. It will also have acquisition and pedagogical
implications.
