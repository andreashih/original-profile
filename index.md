Hi there! I'm a data scientist at [**Wistron Corporation**](https://www.wistron.com/). I just graduated from [**Graduate Institute of Linguistics**](https://linguistics.ntu.edu.tw/), National Taiwan University. My research interests focused on corpus linguistics, computational linguistics, and natural language processing.

I was a member of [**LOPE Lab**](https://lope.linguistics.ntu.edu.tw/), where I learned programming and assisted in linguistics research. My projects included sentiment analysis, word sense disambiguation, and quantitative corpus analysis. In summer of 2021, I interned at [**Delta Electronics**](https://www.deltaww.com/en-US/index) as a backend engineer.

My goal is to contribute to the growing field of Chinese NLP, especially Taiwan Mandarin. Outside of research I enjoy cooking and classical music.
