<p>Hi, my name is Andrea Shih. I received a B.A. in Literature from National Sun Yat-sen University. At this moment, I am pursuing an M.A. degree in Linguistics at National Taiwan University. My research interests lie in the field of <strong>Computational Linguistics</strong>.</p>

<p>I had obtained basic knowledge about Linguistics in college. In addition, I took plenty of courses related to Psychology, which encouraged me to study language from different perspectives. </p>

With an ambition to major in Computational Linguistics, I signed up for <strong><a href="https://rlads2019.github.io/">Introduction to Data Science with R</a></strong> in the very first semester of graduate school. Besides <strong>base R</strong> and <strong>tidyverse packages</strong>, I grasped the concept of <strong>text analytics</strong> through this course. At the end of the class, I cooperated with peers and completed a <strong><a href="https://github.com/rlads2019/project-andreaseki">project</a></strong> featuring text analytics. 

In the following semester (Spring 2020), I signed up for a undergraduate **Python** course, in which I learned its very basis and text analysis. How thrilling it is to completed a <strong><a href="https://github.com/andreashih/docx-search-manipulation">project</a></strong> from scratch! Also, I took [**Corpus Linguistics**](https://alvinntnu.github.io/NTNU_ENC2036/) from NTNU and had grasped the big picture of methods for corpus analysis.  

This semester (Fall 2021), I am taking **statistics** to catch up on knowledge of data science. Meanwhile, I signed up for Corpus Processing Method to improve my corpus analysis skills.
