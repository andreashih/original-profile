Hi, my name is Andrea Shih. I received a B.A. in Literature from National Sun Yat-sen University. At this moment, I am pursuing an M.A. degree in Linguistics at National Taiwan University. My research interests lie in the field of **Computational Linguistics**.


I am currently a research assistant in [**LOPE Lab**](https://lope.linguistics.ntu.edu.tw/), NTU. I also work as a freelance proofreader. Check out [**ESSAY CHECKER**](https://andreashih.github.io/essay-checker/) if you are interested!
