<p>Hi, my name is Andrea Shih. I received a B.A. in Literature from National Sun Yat-sen University. At this moment, I am pursuing an M.A. degree in Linguistics at National Taiwan University. My research interests lie in the field of <strong>Computational Linguistics</strong>.</p>

<p>I had obtained basic knowledge about Linguistics in college. In addition, I took plenty of courses related to Psychology, which encouraged me to study language from different perspectives. </p>
