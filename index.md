<p>Hi, my name is Andrea Shih. I received a B.A. in Literature from National Sun Yat-sen University. At this moment, I am pursuing an M.A. degree in Linguistics at National Taiwan University. My research interests lie in the field of <strong>Computational Linguistics</strong>.</p>

<p>I had obtained basic knowledge about Linguistics in college. In addition, I took plenty of courses related to Psychology, which encouraged me to study language from different perspectives. </p>

<p>The first programming language I learned was <strong>MATLAB</strong>. The focus of the course was to solve mathematical problems with MATLAB. In the very first semester of graduate school, I signed up for <strong><a href="https://rlads2019.github.io/">Introduction to Data Science with R</a></strong>. Besides <strong>base R</strong> and <strong>tidyverse packages</strong>, I grasped the concept of <strong>text analytics</strong> through this course. At the end of the class, I cooperated with peers and completed a <strong><a href="https://github.com/rlads2019/project-andreaseki">project</a></strong> featuring text analytics.</p>
